                About the Movie Section
            </h3>

            <p>
                Most data and links to images for the Movies section come from
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.themoviedb.org/">TheMovieDB</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additional data for Film Titles come from
                <a target="_blank" href="http://www.omdbapi.com/">The Open Movie
                Database</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                At least one plug-in comes from
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/">IMDb</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                While much of the above data are retrieved directly from outside
                APIs and other such sources, data from 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.afi.com/">American Film
                Institute (AFI)</a>
                was manually entered the old fashioned way into a MySQL database.
            </p>
            <p>
                Data are -- <em>hey, it's a plural</em> -- subject to the
                limitations of their sources. (For example, TMDB search results
                currently max out at 20.)

                Whereas the overall purpose of this website is to serve as a
                personal demo/portfolio/workshop of web and data skills, this
                Movies section is not meant to compete with or substitute for
                far more definitive movie websites.

                Whether or not he still clings to an award which he won in 1986
                as a film critic for his college's newspaper, Jeffrey Hartmann
                is not responsible for the texts of overviews and biographies
                supplied by external data sources.
