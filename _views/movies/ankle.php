                About the Movie Section
            </h3>

            <p>
                Most data and links to images for the Movies section come from
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.themoviedb.org/">TheMovieDB</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additional data for Film Titles come from
                <a target="_blank" href="http://www.omdbapi.com/">The Open Movie
                Database</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                At least one plug-in comes from
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/">IMDb</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                While much of the above data are retrieved directly from outside
                APIs and other such sources, data from 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.afi.com/">American Film
                Institute (AFI)</a> and
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bfi.org.uk/">British Film
                Institute (BFI)</a>
                were manually entered the old fashioned way into a MySQL database.
                Re BFI I took the following liberties:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I added "runners up" to Top 10 lists, treating them as
                        ties where applicable and numbering them accordingly at
                        the bottom of each list.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Regarding those polls wherein "franchise" movies were
                        submitted as one project until BFI's policy changed to
                        regard them separately, I treated them as ties and
                        renumbered the affected lists accordingly (e.g. the
                        Godfather films).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Data are -- <em>hey, it's a plural</em> -- subject to the
                limitations of their sources. (For example, TMDB search results
                currently max out at 20.) I am limiting myself to free data
                sources for now.
            </p>

                Filtering is applied here to film projects flagged as "adult" by
                TheMovieDB. Pending "popular demand" I am contemplating a login
                and profile system with preferences (such as whether to allow
                adult images to appear) and permissions (such as data entry).
            </p>

                Whereas the overall purpose of this website is to serve as a
                personal demo/portfolio/workshop of web and data skills, this
                Movies section is not meant to compete with or substitute for
                far more definitive movie websites.

                Whether or not he still clings to an award which he won in 1986
                as a film critic for his college's newspaper, Jeffrey Hartmann
                is not responsible for the texts of overviews and biographies
                supplied by external data sources.
